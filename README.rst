   MEDIA_ROOT + 'cmsplugin_gallery/images'. Make sure it is writable especially
   when running in embedded mode on production server.

#. Very simple template is included with the project. To make it work 100%,
   install jQueryTOOLS for overlay support using your favorite method
   http://flowplayer.org/tools/download/index.html

Usage
=====

The easiest approach is to use a nice feature of cmsplugin_gallery -
the template autodiscovery. In order to take advantage of it, add your custom
templates in the cmsplugin_gallery subdirectory of any of template dirs scanned
by Django.

If you don't want to use the autodiscovery, you can hardcode available templates
in settings.py using following setting:

::

    CMSPLUGIN_GALLERY_TEMPLATES = (
        ('app/template.html', 'Template #1', ),
        ('app/other_template.html', 'Template #2', ),
    )

Embed as a typical plugin.
